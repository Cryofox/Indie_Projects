-Now for Bullet Physics!

Aim Animation at Mouse Cursor
Set LeftClick to Shoot Animation


System should use a Start/Direction implementation for all projectile effects
Different Types of Projectiles:
Bullet - Shot from start, shifts position each second till collides with an object
Beam - Shoot a Line-Intersect untill the first collider is hit, then draw a beam made up of a "Head", Tile-Able "Body" parts, and a "Tail" for where the collision occurs.
Seeker (Detected) - Will shoot like a bullet but arc when an enemy is within Detection radius.
Seeker (RandomCorrected) - Will shoot missiles in arc like motion towards Target Cursor


The Beam is also how a Grapple Hook effect would be constructed.

Beam Types:
	Laser 		(Continuous)
	Carbine  (Shoots a burst that dissipates)
	Electric	(Like Laser, OR branches off and tags enemies near the beam).
	ArcLight (Laser that shoots in direction but curves? towards enemies). 
Will require curved pieces to represent how tight curves can be.


All Objects will need to be rotated in the correct direction.
Objects must not only travel in that direction but be rotated to face it.

Broken Steps:

	Create Animation For Aim Up, Down, Forward.
	Sync so "Gun" aims at Target.
		Target is just a Vector2, human overwrites Target with mouse Position.
	
How to Sync, use 90-> -90 degrees as reference point. If angle >90 || < -90, flip character 
and use 180-Angle as values.

Multiply Animation -1,1 by Percentage of Angle from -90 - 90. And thats the aim.

The class only modifies the Parameter, Mecanim handles animation interpolation.



Once this is done Create Gun Class for handling Projectile Spawning, Reload Timing, Accuracy etc.


Projectile Manager (Static) will handle the Management of all Projectiles.
